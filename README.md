## Vscode Projects Overview

Simple projects overview for vscode.

You set a projects folder that contains your projects, and the view will list all subfolders and files by recency.

Click on one of the project subfolders to open it in the current workspace.

The view will open with a new window that doesnt have a workspace or folder.

It can also be opened with the ctrl+f1 or ctrl+alt+r keyboard shorcuts, or using ">FS: Show projects view" in the command palette.
